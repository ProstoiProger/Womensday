I wish you good luck in the third trimester, so that you don’t die with your regimen, and so that you calmly survive discrete mathematics with Duman Adilet. Why didn’t I wish you happiness? Because I myself will make you happy, I will do everything so that your smile never disappears from your face, because I really like your sweet smile and sweet laugh, and I often repeat your voice message with laughter. Just your smile gives me a surge of strength and energy to work and never give up. Thank you for all your support and faith in me, I promise that I will never let you down! Just thank you for teaching me something new every day. Thank you for appearing in my life❤️",
